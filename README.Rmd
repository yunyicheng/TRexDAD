## Description

Designing oligonucleotides is a significant part of Tile Region Exchange mutagenesis (T-Rex). It is a DNA assembly technique based on cassette mutagenesis, which utilizes a short, double-stranded oligonucleotide sequence (gene cassette) to replace a fragment of target DNA. It uses complementary restriction enzyme digest ends on the target DNA and gene cassette to achieve specificity. Here is a general overview of Tile Region Exchange and cassette mutagenesis.

However, derive the assembly design by hand is often error-prone and time-consuming since the fidelity of resulting oligonucleotides does not merely depend on mere rules. Therefore, a data-driven solution is required for designing oligonucleotides with high correct assembly rate []. Although there are web tools currently available for this procedure, few of them utilized Data-optimized Assembly Design.`TRexDAD` is a streamline tool that facilitates oligonucleotide design for Tile Region Exchange Mutagenesis by harnessing Data-optimized Assembly Design (DAD) techniques, along with visualization of optimization process. The package is targeted for researchers who perform Tile Region Exchange Mutagenesis for some genes of interest and need an efficient and reliable streamline to produce mutagenizing oligonucleotides. The scope of the R package is to improve the work flow in Tile Region Exchange Mutagenesis, facilitating open-source researches for interested bioinformatitians and computational biologists. The `TRexDAD` package was developed using `R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)`, `Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)` and `Running under: macOS Sonoma 14.1.1`.

## Package Overview

```{r}
ls("package:TRexDAD")
data(package = "TRexDAD") 
browseVignettes("TRexDAD")
```

`TRexDAD` contains 10 functions. Since they are all parts of an integrated pipeline, they are go to one R script, `pipeline.R`. Here are the workflow illustration and detailed explaination of them.

![Pipeline Workflow](inst/extdata/pipeline_workflow.png)

1.  ***execute_and_plot*** is the work flow function which wraps up most of the other functions. It performs an optimization process to determine the optimal tile positions in a gene sequence and plots the progression of the score over iterations. It provides two customization parameters: `iteration_max` and `scan_rate`. If not other specified, these parameter will have default values: `iteration_max=30`, `scan_rate=7`.

2.  ***split_into_codons*** takes a gene sequence (as a string) and splits it into codons.

3.  ***oligo_cost*** calculates the cost of oligonucleotides (oligos) based on 
the number of tiles and the number of codons.

4. ***calculate_optimal_tiles*** calculates the oligo cost for a range of tile numbers and finds the number of tiles that minimizes this cost. It also computes the global length of the tiles.

5. ***get_overhangs*** calculates the overhang sequences at the specified positions in a gene sequence. Depending on the flag, it returns these sequences as either `DNAString` objects or plain character strings.

6. ***get_all_overhangs*** computes overhang sequences for a given list of positions in a gene sequence. It iteratively calls the `get_overhangs` function to calculate the head and tail overhangs for each position and accumulates them in a list.

7. ***calculate_local_score*** calculates a score for a specific tile within a gene sequence. The score is based on palindromicity, length variation from a global standard, and on-target reactivity, using a pre-defined overhang fidelity dataframe.

8. ***calculate_global_score*** calculates a global score for a list of positions in a gene sequence. The score takes into account off-target reactions, repetitions, and the sum of local scores (by calling `obtain_score`). 

9. ***pick_position*** selects a position from a list of positions for optimization based on their scores. It uses a weighted sampling approach where the weights are inversely proportional to the scores of the positions.

10. ***optimize_position*** optimizes a single position within a list of positions. It adjusts the specified position to maximize the overall score (obtained via `calculate_scores`). The function supports different optimization modes, including greedy and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches.


## Contributions

The author of the package is Yunyi Cheng. 

The author wrote the *execute_and_plot* function, which performs an optimization process to determine the optimal tile positions in a gene sequence and plots the progression of the score over iterations. 

Other user-accessible functions are also developed by the author. Most of them serve as helper functions for the *execute_and_plot* function.

`Biostrings` R package is used for calculating reverse complement of overhangs in the *get_overhangs* function.

`readxl` R package is used for reading excel file `overhang_fidelity.xlsx` containing tested overhangs's reactivity against each other. `overhang_fidelity.xlsx` is from the study by New England Biolabs.

`forstringr` R package is used for manipulating splitted target gene (a list of codons) in the *get_overhangs* function.

The `stats` R package is used for optimizing gene tile length and number of tiles. It is used in  *calculate_optimal_tiles* function and *execute_and_plot* function.
