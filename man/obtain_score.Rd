\title{Obtain Score for a Given Tile}
\usage{
obtain_score(start, end)
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{An integer representing the start position of the tile in the gene sequence.}

\item{end}{An integer representing the end position of the tile in the gene sequence.}
}
\value{
The calculated score for the specified tile, which takes into account
the palindromicity, length variation, and on-target reactivity.
}
\description{
This function calculates a score for a specific tile within a gene sequence.
The score is based on palindromicity, length variation from a global standard,
and on-target reactivity, using a pre-defined overhang fidelity dataframe.
}
\examples{
# Assuming predefined variables and setup:
# start = 1, end = 3, overhang_fidelity (dataframe), length_tiles_global (value)
obtain_score(1, 3)

}
